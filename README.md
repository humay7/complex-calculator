# complex-calculator
Worked in a team of 3 students to build a calculator with a client/server architecture that operates on complex numbers using Java.

# Complex Calculator
Here are the steps to launch the calculator.


## Compilation
First compile all .java files using : javac *.java


## Running the server
Open a terminal, and launch the server with: java Server
The server is now ready.


## Opening the Calculator window for operations
Open another terminal, and launch the calculator with: java Calculator
The calculator should open.


## Working with the calculator
Perform the available operations on the entered complex numbers and get the result.
Enter complex numbers in this form: a (+/-) bi
Using parentheses is also recommended. 

## Closing the calculator
It's possible to close the calculator and stop the running Calculator process by clicking exit on the window.


## Stopping the server
Stop the server from the first terminal.


## ADDITIONAL
When running the server and the client (the Calculator in our implementation) on two different machines connected to the same network, it's important to change the IP address for the client's socket from the local host's address to the server's IP address.
